# Code Layout

These libraries are split into:

- [Generated client libraries][client-libs]: The per-service libraries as used by users. The source code for these is generated by the Client Generator.
- [Client Generator][client-gen]: The code generator for the above.
- [Support Libraries][support-libs]: Support code for the client libraries.

[support-libs]: https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-dotnet-client/tree/main/Src/Support
[client-libs]: https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-dotnet-client/tree/main/Src/Generated
[client-gen]: https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-dotnet-client/tree/main/ClientGenerator

## Building and .NET Core

We use Visual Studio 2022 to edit the Support Libraries.

We use [dotnet cli][dotnetcli] for testing and building both the generated Client Libraries and the Support Libraries.

[dotnetcli]: https://github.com/dotnet/cli

## Tests

Support Library tests use [XUnit][xunit].

Tests are run using the `dotnet test` command in the relevant source directory.
