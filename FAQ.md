### What does this library being in "maintenance mode" mean?

It means that the libraries in this repository are considered mature and complete; so we do not expect to add any more major features.

We will continue to support these libraries, fix bugs, and add minor features as required to support ongoing changes to the .NET platform.

We will continue to release new versions of all API libraries as they are available; and release new API libraries as new services become available.

### Why aren't Unity, Xamarin or UWP supported?

At a team discussion in October 2018 we made the decision to not proceed with support for these platforms.
We don't see evidence that there would be enough usage to justify the technical work and
infrastructure required for us to fully support these extra platforms.

We will revisit this decision on a regular basis, in case the situation changes.
